If you run my application from Main.java, Main menu will shown on console

========== MAIN MENU =========
1. GENERATE NEW RANDOM WORDS
2. SHOW ALL WORDS
3. MOST LONG WORD
4. MOST SHORT WORD
5. FIND TOTAL WORD BY CONTAINS
6. MAKE WORD EXCITED!
7. REMOVE SOME WORD
                DEFAULT : EXIT
==============================
ENTER YOUR CHOICE:

Enter your choice for menu, if you enter other than 1-7, Application will close.
When you done with some menu, you can repeat the Application by answer (Y/y).

If you run my Application from WordTest.java, you will see my JUnit Test.

Thanks,
